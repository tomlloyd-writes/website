Nope, nothing to do with meeting my wife, I dunno when that happened. Who keeps track of such things? There is, however, one date that has stuck in my mine – 16<sup>th</sup> of March, 2006 – because that’s the day I began a published author and The Stormcaller was unleashed upon the world.</p><p> </p><p>Yup, my little (?!) boy Isak is ten years old.</p><p> </p><p>Back then publishing had a different landscape, the interweb was a very different place, and the SFF community was almost entirely foreign to me. I’d just written a book because it wanted to be written. And then? Well it got released into English twice (three times if you count the audio edition), Russian, German, French, Czech and Polish. The English versions of Stormcaller have sold over 60,000 copies between them and just yesterday I got an email from a guy who enjoyed the series enough to take the time to write to me and tell me that, ten years on.</p><p> </p><p>It’s been by far my most successful book; it’s paid a lot of bills and remains something I’m very proud of. Even when I got the chance to revise it I didn’t want to do much, just tidy up a few parts to make them easier to read. For better or worse it’s my debut book and the start of the million+ words that comprise the Twilight Reign. While it may not become a worldwide phenomenon with HBO series or movie deals, it’s still quite an achievement.</p><p> </p><p>Some people loved it, some hated it. Some people wanted it to be another book by Joe Abercrombie or Scott Lynch (with whom I was published as a trio of debuts… I know, tough company right?), and were furious when they discovered a traditional epic instead. But lots of people loved it and I continue to feel humbled whenever I’m told someone’s read (and re-read) the idle thoughts of this modestly talented writer.</p><p> </p><p>I’ve today sent the full ms of Princess of Blood to my agent and brother for first thoughts. It’ll be my ninth book to come out and this week I’ve had several hugely talented authors say humbling things about book 1, Stranger of Tempest, so tonight there will be wine. While I’ll be raising a glass to Isak, Mihn and all the others (not individually though, the cast list had approximately 500 names by the end) I’ll also be toasting two others in particular – John Parker, formerly of MBA and Zeno literary agencies, and Jo Fletcher, formerly of Gollancz now rightful queen of her own imprint, who saw something in the manuscript that made them willing to put more work in than anyone could reasonably expect.</p><p> </p><p>And lastly, cheers to all of you who bought it. No refunds.</p><div class="social-likes" data-title="The Stormcaller - ten years on." data-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20231201141539oe_/http://tomlloyd.co.uk/books/blog_posts/the-stormcaller-ten-years-on/" data-counters="yes"><div class="plusone" title="Share link on Google+"> </div></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__tag"><h3 class="content__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="content__tag__list"><li><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/tags/posts/">Posts</a></li></ul></div><div class="content__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="content__related"><h3 class="content__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image is-img-loading"><img src="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/media/posts/5/Stormcaller-special-ed-1.jpg" srcset="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/media/posts/5/responsive/Stormcaller-special-ed-1-xs.jpg 384w, https://tomlloyd.co.uk/media/posts/5/responsive/Stormcaller-special-ed-1-sm.jpg 600w, https://tomlloyd.co.uk/media/posts/5/responsive/Stormcaller-special-ed-1-md.jpg 768w, https://tomlloyd.co.uk/media/posts/5/responsive/Stormcaller-special-ed-1-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 80vw, 50vw" loading="lazy" height="2411" width="1563" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/the-stormcaller-10th-anniversary-edition.html" class="invert">The Stormcaller – 10th anniversary edition</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/tags/posts/" class="c-card__tag">Posts</a></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=9c5ab7a87221183f149a42b3cceb7956"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
