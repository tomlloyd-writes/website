Seriously?! Oh come on. I know it’s a Warhammer novel and that may distort things but come on, gimme a break here!<br>Ruin by John Gwynne (Pan Macmillan) 1.7k – A man who’s done well at the Gemmells and seems to be selling loads, but still far fewer ratings than others on the list<br>The Liar’s Key by Mark Lawrence (Harper/Voyager) 5k – perhaps I should have expected this would do well given how committed his fans are, but still it was book 2 in a new series with lots of big names on the list.</p><p> </p><p>So, first and foremost, apologies to the Gemmell committee. Clear (and perhaps inevitably) it’s a more nuanced matter as to who’s getting the votes in these awards that I’d characterised.</p><p>As for further thoughts about the list. Cameron actually has sold better than I’d realised. They’re not vast numbers on Goodreads or Amazon but very good all the same. He’s got a very successful career in historical fiction I know, but I’m not sure that could explain it by itself. Correia’s fanbase is large and motivated on the awards front so… yeah, there’s that. Interestingly he’s the only one to not have a UK publisher on this UK-based award. Guymer is a Warhammer writer and so far as I’m aware they follow different sales paths – checking Goodreads and Amazon you’d think it’s sold almost nothing, let alone enough to get ahead of folk like Abercrombie on a popular vote.</p><p>As for Gwynne and Lawrence, they’re the least surprising ones on the list even if I didn’t think they’d be on it.</p><p>And lastly – I’ve got no bloody idea who’s going to win out of that lot! If I had to put money on it I’d go for Lawrence, but clearly there’s a lot going on in this vote so I’ll be keen to see the numbers if they get released. I’m reminded that I originally said it’d be a big old sausage fest, and there I did seem to get it right, but there’s probably a lot to be unpicked by others about the nature of various fanbases.</p><div class="social-likes" data-title="Gemmell shortlist and apology" data-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20231201141539oe_/http://tomlloyd.co.uk/books/blog_posts/gemmell-shortlist-and-apology/" data-counters="yes"><div class="vkontakte" title="Share link on VK"> </div></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__tag"><h3 class="content__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="content__tag__list"><li><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/tags/posts/">Posts</a></li></ul></div><div class="content__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="content__related"><h3 class="content__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/some-inaccurate-gemmell-figures.html" class="invert">Some inaccurate Gemmell figures</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/tags/posts/" class="c-card__tag">Posts</a></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/embittered-ranting-about-the-gemmell-awards.html" class="invert">Embittered Ranting about the Gemmell Awards</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><a href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/tags/posts/" class="c-card__tag">Posts</a></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=9c5ab7a87221183f149a42b3cceb7956"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
