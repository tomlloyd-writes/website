They never did, but Eve found a way to gain control from the devil in her mind all the same. And so she’s out, but not exactly cured and walking something of a tightrope. The devil inside wants to play, but going back isn’t an option.</p><p> </p><p>When an MI5 officer comes to find Eve, it threatens to upset this delicate balance as she finds herself returning to her grandfather’s mysterious house – the place where things started to go wrong for her. With a fractured and unreliable memory, she doesn’t know why MI5 might need to access a house that’s been shut up for years, but slowly she begins to piece together the hidden family legacy of the Carnells. Someone is spying on the government by means unknown and the stakes are raised as they think Eve, as the heir to Rowanhill Hall, is a threat to their plans.</p><p> </p><p>In some ways this could be seen as a “write what you know” story. Rowanhill Hall is based on the house my grandparents owned for forty years, just a bit bigger and grander in a number of ways. The protagonist being an awkward weirdo who doesn’t really fit in anywhere and clearly can’t even do posh and privileged adequately… well, who knows where people find their inspiration? Sadly the basement doesn’t exist except in a slew of dreams I had as a teenager - the story about the soldier is true though!</p><p> </p><p>After years of epic fantasy, SF, and historical fiction, wow it’s nice to set something in the real world for a change. So much easier to write, I don’t know why people don’t do this more often. The book came from a few different inspirations, one of which being my realization that urban fantasy (the Peter Grant kind, not the shagging werewolves kind) is my go-to comfort reading. Even the ones that aren’t great I find relaxing and given everything that’s happened in the world over the last few years, I wanted to do more of that.</p><p> </p><p>This book started out as a feverish stream of consciousness that got fired over to the ever-patient KV Johansen, inspired by a short story from 2013-ish that clearly had unfinished business with me. I didn’t have a plan, didn’t have an overall idea or aesthetic I was aiming for, I just wanted to see where this idea took me. Sadly after years of trying to justify my place on the Gollancz list, the combination of dwindling sales, covid interruptions and shifting tastes from the core readership meant selling my work to publishers is a difficult thing, but Falling Dark did pretty well by itself so here we are. The time and space to write it as I want, the need to sell books and justify the time spent far more immediate and sharp.</p><p> </p><p>I’d spotted Eshpur on twitter years ago and loved their stained-glass pieces, so with the book almost ready I was keen to drop them a line and see what we could do. I’ve always had opinions on my covers, usually had an idea of what I wanted, but here I struggled a bit. Generating the idea plus working through the details isn’t something I’ve needed to do before, plus all the book was written as though looking out of Eve’s eyes. I hadn’t spent a lot of time thinking about what she looked like even, as odd as it may be to say that! Especially with lots of little elements on the border of the image, I had to go into a lot more detail than in the past, like when my brief has been “man holding shotgun faces down balrog – go have fun with that”. It was a fun process though and a good lesson for the future.</p><p> </p><p>Now the book’s coming soon – preorder the ebook here – with the paperback also going on sale on the 15<sup>th</sup> and possibly an audio edition in a month or two. But where do I go with the Devil Diaries after this? There’s the follow-up novel, Seven Devils, of which I wrote 20+k words of before getting busy with work. At that point I realized I wanted something shorter to get my teeth first so there will be a novella first; The Devil in the Vicarage. Another Eve story, but not a key installment of the series in the same way, hopefully that’ll be a fun, quick read to bridge the gap between releases.</p><p> </p><p>Beyond that, who knows? Writing is a demanding hobby and I’m still getting my head around it being that rather than a significant component of my day job and income. Eve’s tale won’t end there and maybe non-romantic epic fantasy will see a resurgence, in which case Oakfall may finally get picked up. Until then, I hope you enjoy Devil Inside and don’t forget to leave those reviews! It genuinely does make a difference, particularly in the early months.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__share"></div></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://tomlloyd.co.uk/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=9c5ab7a87221183f149a42b3cceb7956"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
